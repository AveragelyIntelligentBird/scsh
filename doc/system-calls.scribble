@title{System Calls}
Scsh provides (almost) complete access to the basic Unix kernel services: processes, files, signals
and so forth.  These procedures comprise a Scheme binding for Posix, with a few of the more standard
extensions thrown in (e.g., symbolic links, @code{fchown}, @code{fstat}, sockets).

@section{Errors}
@; this section is extremely out of date / touch. need to
@; A: update to talk in terms of srfi exceptions
@; B: Either link to, or (more likely) repatriate the s48 errno api.
@; repatriating is favorable so that we're not just passing integers around and are using objects
@; with a bit more info.
Scsh syscalls never return error codes, and do not use a global @code{errno} variable to report
errors. Errors are consistently reported by raising exceptions. This frees up the procedures to
return useful values, and allows the programmer to assume that
@emph{if a syscall returns, it succeeded.} This greatly simplifies the flow of the code from the
programmer's point of view.

Since Scheme does not yet have a standard exception system, the scsh definition remains somewhat
vague on the actual form of exceptions and exception handlers. When a standard exception system is
defined, scsh will move to it. For now, scsh uses the scm exception system, with a simple sugaring
on top to hide the details in the common case.

System call error exceptions contain the Unix @code{errno} code reported by the system call. Unlike
C, the @code{errno} value is a part of the exception packet, it is @emph{not} accessed through a
global variable.

For reference purposes, the Unix @code{errno} numbers are bound to the variables @code{errno/perm},
@code{errno/noent}, etc. System calls never return \@code{error/intr}---they automatically retry.

@; update this function and this section to use legit errnos.
@defproc[#:link-target? #f (errno-error [errno integer?] [syscall string?] [data any/c] ...) any]{
Raises a Unix error exception for Unix error number @var{errno}. The @var{syscall} and @var{data}
arguments are packaged up in the exception packet passed to the exception handler.
}

@deftogether[(@defform[#:link-target? #f (with-errno-handler handler-spec ... body)]
              @defproc[#:link-target? #f (with-errno-handler* [handler (-> integer? (listof any/c) (values any/c ...))]
                                                              [thunk (-> (values any/c ...))])
                       (values any/c ...)])]{
Unix syscalls raise error exceptions by calling @code{errno-error}. Programs can use
@code{with-errno-handler*} to establish handlers for these exceptions.

If a Unix error arises while @var{thunk} is executing, @var{handler} is called on two arguments
like this:

@codeblock{(handler errno packet)}

@var{packet} is a list of the form

@codeblock{(errno-msg syscall data ...)}

where @var{errno-msg} is the standard Unix error message for the error, @var{syscall} is the
procedure that generated the error, and @var{data} is a list of information generated by the error,
which varies from syscall to syscall.

If @var{handler} returns, the handler search continues upwards. @var{handler} can acquire the
exception by invoking a saved continuation. This procedure can be sugared over with the following
syntax:

@codeblock{(with-errno-handler
                 ((errno packet) clause ...)
             body ...+)}

This form executes the body forms with a particular errno handler installed. When an errno error is
raised, the handler search machinery will bind variable @var{errno} to the error's integer code, and
variable @var{packet} to the error's auxiliary data packet. Then, the clauses will be checked for a
match. The first clause that matches is executed, and its value is the value of the entire
@code{with-errno-handler} form. If no clause matches, the handler search continues.

Error clauses have two forms

@codeblock{((errno ...) body ...)
           (else body ...)}

In the first type of clause, the @var{errno} forms are integer expressions. They are evaluated and
compared to the error's errno value. An @code{else} clause matches any errno value. Note that the
@var{errno} and @var{data} variables are lexically visible to the error clauses.

Example:

@codeblock{(with-errno-handler
                ((errno packet) ; Only handle 3 particular errors.
                 ((errno/wouldblock errno/again)
                   (loop))
                 ((errno/acces)
                   (format #t "Not allowed access!")
                   #f))

             (foo frobbotz)
             (blatz garglemumph))}

It is not defined what dynamic context the handler executes in, so fluid variables cannot reliably
be referenced.
@; ^ check exception srfi to see if this is specified.

Note that Scsh system calls always retry when interrupted, so that the @code{errno/intr} exception
is never raised. If the programmer wishes to abort a system call on an interrupt, he should have the
interrupt handler explicitly raise an exception or invoke a stored continuation to throw out of the
system call.
}

@subsection{Interactive Mode and Error Handling}
Scsh runs in two modes: interactive and script mode. It starts up in interactive mode if the scsh
interpreter is started up with no script argument. Otherwise, scsh starts up in script mode.  The
mode determines whether scsh prints prompts in between reading and evaluating forms, and it affects
the default error handler. In interactive mode, the default error handler will report the error, and
generate an interactive breakpoint so that the user can interact with the system to examine, fix, or
dismiss from the error. In script mode, the default error handler causes the scsh process to exit.

When scsh forks a child with @code{(fork)}, the child resets to script mode.
This can be overridden if the programmer wishes.

@section{I/O}

@subsection{Standard RnRS I/O Procedures}
In scsh, most standard RnRS I/O operations (such as @code{display} or @code{read-char}) work on both
integer file descriptors and Scheme ports. When doing I/O with a file descriptor, the I/O operation
is done directly on the file, bypassing any buffered data that may have accumulated in an associated
port. Note that character-at-a-time operations such as @code{read-char} are likely to be quite slow
when performed directly upon file descriptors.

The standard RnRS procedures @code{read-char}, @code{char-ready?}, @code{write}, @code{display},
@code{newline}, and @code{write-char} are all generic, accepting integer file descriptor arguments
as well as ports. Scsh also mandates the availability of @code{format}, and further requires
@code{format} to accept file descriptor arguments as well as ports.

The procedures @code{peek-char} and @code{read} do @emph{not} accept file descriptor arguments,
since these functions require the ability to read ahead in the input stream, a feature not supported
by Unix I/O.

@subsection{Port Manipulation and Standard Ports}

This procedure is analogous to @code{current-output-port}, but produces a port used for error

These special forms are simply syntactic sugar for the @code{with-current-input-port*} procedure and

@defproc[#:link-target? #f (close [fd/port (or/c integer? port?)]) boolean?]{
Closes the port or file descriptor.

If @var{fd/port} is a file descriptor, and it has a port allocated to it, the port is shifted to a
new file descriptor created with @code{(dup fd/port)} before closing @code{fd/port}. The port then
has its revealed count set to zero.  This reflects the design criteria that ports are not associated
with file descriptors, but with the streams they denote.

To close a file descriptor, and any associated port it might have, you must instead say one of
(as appropriate):

@codeblock{(close (fdes->inport  fd))
           (close (fdes->outport fd))}

The procedure returns true if it closed an open port. If the port was already closed, it returns
false; this is not an error.

@defproc[#:link-target? #f (stdports->stdio) undefined]{
Synchronises Unix' standard I/O file descriptors and Scheme's current I/O ports. Causes the standard
I/O file descriptors (0, 1, and 2) take their values from the current I/O ports. It is exactly
equivalent to the series of redirections:

@codeblock{(dup (current-input-port)  0)
           (dup (current-output-port) 1)
           (dup (error-output-port)   2)}

same port.}

              @defform[#:link-target? #f (with-stdio-ports body ...+)])]{
@code{with-stdio-ports*} binds the standard ports @code{(current-input-port)},
@code{(current-output-port)}, and @code{(error-output-port)} to be ports on file descriptors 0, 1,
2, and then calls @var{thunk}. It is equivalent to:

@codeblock{(with-current-input-port (fdes->inport 0)
             (with-current-output-port (fdes->inport 1)
               (with-error-output-port (fdes->outport 2)

The @code{with-stdio-ports} special form is merely syntactic sugar.
}

@subsection{String ports}
Scheme48 has string ports, which you can use. Scsh has not committed to the particular interface or
names that scheme48 uses, so be warned that the interface described herein may be liable to change.
@; ^ isn't there a SRFI for this? change wording or remove if so

A string output port is a port that collects the characters given to it into a string. The
accumulated string is retrieved by applying @code{string-output-port-output} to the port.
}

@defproc[#:link-target? #f (call-with-string-output-port [procedure (-> port? any)]) string?]{
The @var{procedure} value is called on a port. When it returns, @code{call-with-string-output-port}
returns a string containing the characters that were written to that port during the execution of
@var{procedure}.
}

@subsection{Revealed Ports and File Descriptors}

The material in this section and the following one is not critical for most applications. You may
safely skim or completely skip this section on a first reading.

Dealing with Unix file descriptors in a Scheme environment is difficult. In Unix, open files are
part of the process environment, and are referenced by small integers called
@emph{file descriptors}. Open file descriptors are the fundamental way I/O redirections are passed
to subprocesses, since file descriptors are preserved across fork's and exec's.

Scheme, on the other hand, uses ports for specifying I/O sources. Ports are garbage-collected Scheme
objects, not integers. Ports can be garbage collected; when a port is collected, it is also closed.
Because file descriptors are just integers, it's impossible to garbage collect them---you wouldn't
be able to close file descriptor 3 unless there were no 3's in the system, and you could further
prove that your program would never again compute a 3. This is difficult at best.

If a Scheme program only used Scheme ports, and never actually used file descriptors, this would not
be a problem. But Scheme code must descend to the file descriptor level in at least two
circumstances:

@itemlist[@item{when interfacing to foreign code}
          @item{when interfacing to a subprocess}]

This causes a problem. Suppose we have a Scheme port constructed on top of file descriptor 2. We
intend to fork off a program that will inherit this file descriptor. If we drop references to the
port, the garbage collector may prematurely close file 2 before we fork the subprocess. The
interface described below is intended to fix this and other problems arising from the mismatch
between ports and file descriptors.

The scsh kernel maintains a port table that maps a file descriptor to the scheme port allocated for
it (or, #f if there is no port allocated for this file descriptor). This is used to ensure that
there is at most one open port for each open file descriptor.

Conceptually, the port data structure for file ports has two fields besides the descriptor:
@var{revealed} and @var{closed?}. When a file port is closed with @code{(close port)}, the port's
file descriptor is closed, its entry in the port table is cleared, and the port's @var{closed?}
field is set to true.

When a file descriptor is closed with @code{(close fdes)}, any associated port is shifted to a new
file descriptor created with @code{(dup fdes)}. The port has its revealed count reset to zero (and
hence becomes eligible for closing on GC). See discussion below. To really put a stake through a
descriptor's heart without waiting for associated ports to be GC'd, you must say one of

@codeblock{(close (fdes->inport fdes))
           (close (fdes->output fdes))}

The @var{revealed} field is an aid to garbage collection. It is an integer semaphore. If it is zero,
the port's file descriptor can be closed when the port is collected. Essentially, the @var{revealed}
field reflects whether or not the port's file descriptor has escaped to the scheme user. If the
scheme user doesn't know what file descriptor is associated with a given port, then he can't
possibly retain an ``integer handle'' on the port after dropping pointers to the port itself, so the
garbage collector is free to close the file.

Ports allocated with @code{open-output-file} and @code{open-input-file} are unrevealed ports---i.e.,
@var{revealed} is initialised to 0. No one knows the port's file descriptor, so the file descriptor
can be closed when the port is collected.

The functions @code{fdes->output-port}, @code{fdes->input-port}, @code{port->fdes} are used to shift
back and forth between file descriptors and ports.  When @code{port->fdes} reveals a port's file
descriptor, it increments the port's @var{revealed} field.  When the user is through with the file
descriptor, he can call @code{(release-port-handle port)}, which decrements the count. The function
@code{(call/fdes fd/port proc)} automates this protocol. @code{call/fdes} uses @code{dynamic-wind}
to enforce the protocol. If @var{proc} throws out of the @code{call/fdes} application, the unwind
handler releases the descriptor handle; if the user subsequently tries to throw @emph{back} into
@var{proc}'s context, the wind handler raises an error. When the user maps a file descriptor to a
port with @code{fdes->outport} or @code{fdes->inport}, the port has its revealed field incremented.

Not all file descriptors are created by requests to make ports.  Some are inherited on process
invocation via
@hyperlink["http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=exec&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+4.3-RELEASE&format=html"]{exec(2)}},
and are simply part of the global environment. Subprocesses may depend upon them, so if a port is
later allocated for these file descriptors, is should be considered as a revealed port. For example,
when the scheme shell's process starts up, it opens ports on file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 for the
initial values of @code{(current-input-port)}, @code{(current-output-port)}, and
@code{(error-output-port)}. These ports are initialised with @var{revealed} set to 1, so that stdin,
stdout, and stderr are not closed even if the user drops the port.

Unrevealed file ports have the nice property that they can be closed when all pointers to the port
are dropped. This can happen during gc, or at an @code{exec()}---since all memory is dropped at an
@code{exec()}. No one knows the file descriptor associated with the port, so the exec'd process
certainly can't refer to it.

This facility preserves the transparent close-on-collect property for file ports that are used in
straightforward ways, yet allows access to the underlying Unix substrate without interference from
the garbage collector. This is critical, since shell programming absolutely requires access to the
Unix file descriptors, as their numerical values are a critical part of the process interface.

A port's underlying file descriptor can be shifted around with @code{dup(2)} when convenient. That
is, the actual file descriptor on top of which a port is constructed can be shifted around
underneath the port by the scsh kernel when necessary.  This is important, because when the user is
setting up file descriptors prior to a @code{exec(2)}, he may explicitly use a file descriptor that
has already been allocated to some port. In this case, the scsh kernel just shifts the port's file
descriptor to some new location with @code{dup}, freeing up its old descriptor.  This prevents
errors from happening in the following scenario.  Suppose we have a file open on port @var{f}.  Now
we want to run a program that reads input on file 0, writes output to file 1, errors to file 2, and
logs execution information on file 3. We want to run this program with input from @code{f}. So we
write:

@codeblock{(run (/usr/shivers/bin/prog)
                (> 1 output.txt)
                (> 2 error.log)
                (> 3 trace.log)
                (= 0 ,f))}

Now, suppose by ill chance that, unbeknownst to us, when the operating system opened @code{f}'s
file, it allocated descriptor 3 for it. If we blindly redirect @code{trace.log} into file descriptor
3, we'll clobber @code{f}! However, the port-shuffling machinery saves us: when the @code{run} form
tries to dup @code{trace.log}'s file descriptor to 3, @code{dup} will notice that file descriptor 3
is already associated with an unrevealed port (i.e., @code{f}). So, it will first move @code{f} to
some other file descriptor. This keeps @code{f} alive and well so that it can subsequently be dup'd
into descriptor 0 for @code{prog}'s stdin.

The port-shifting machinery makes the following guarantee: a port is only moved when the underlying
file descriptor is closed, either by a @code{close()} or a @code{dup2()} operation. Otherwise a
port/file-descriptor association is stable.

Under normal circumstances, all this machinery just works behind the scenes to keep things
straightened out. The only time the user has to think about it is when he starts accessing file
descriptors from ports, which he should almost never have to do. If a user starts asking what file
descriptors have been allocated to what ports, he has to take responsibility for managing this
information.

@subsection{Port-Mapping Machinery}

The procedures provided in this section are almost never needed. You may safely skim or completely
skip this section on a first reading.

Here are the routines for manipulating ports in scsh. The important points to remember are:

@itemlist[@item{A file port is associated with an open file, not a particular file descriptor.}
          @item{The association between a file port and a particular file descriptor is never
                changed @emph{except} when the file descriptor is explicitly closed. ``Closing''
                includes being used as the target of a @code{dup2}, so the set of procedures below
                that close their targets are @code{close}, two-argument @code{dup}, and
                @code{move->fdes}. If the target file descriptor of one of these routines has an
                allocated port, the port will be shifted to another freshly-allocated file
                descriptor, and marked as unrevealed, thus preserving the port but freeing its old
                file descriptor.}]

These rules are what is necessary to ``make things work out'' with no surprises in the general case.

@deftogether[(@defproc[#:link-target? #f (fdes->inport [fd integer?]) port?]

revealed count is incremented.

count to 1.

These procedures provide the functionality of C's @code{dup()} and @code{dup2()}. The different
routines return different types of values: @code{dup->inport}, @code{dup->outport}, and
@code{dup->fdes} return input ports, output ports, and integer file descriptors, respectively.
@code{dup}'s return value depends on on the type of @var{fd/port}---it maps fd -> fd and port ->
port.

These procedures use the Unix @code{dup()} syscall to replicate the file descriptor or file port
@var{fd/port}. If a @var{newfd} file descriptor is given, it is used as the target of the dup
operation, i.e., the operation is a @code{dup2()}. In this case, procedures that return a port (such
as @code{dup->inport}) will return one with the revealed count set to one. For example,
@code{(dup (current-input-port) 5)} produces a new port with underlying file descriptor 5, whose
revealed count is 1. If @var{newfd} is not specified, then the operating system chooses the file
descriptor, and any returned port is marked as unrevealed.

If the @var{newfd} target is given, and some port is already using that file descriptor, the port is
first quietly shifted (with another @code{dup}) to some other file descriptor (zeroing its revealed
count).

Since scheme doesn't provide read/write ports, @code{dup->inport} and @code{dup->outport} can be
useful for getting an output version of an input port, or @emph{vice versa}.  For example, if
@code{p} is an input port open on a tty, and we would like to do output to that tty, we can simply
use @code{(dup->outport p)} to produce an equivalent output port for the tty. Be sure to open the
file with the @code{open/read+write} flag for this.

@code{write-only}, or @code{read-write}. The returned port is an input port if the @var{options}
permit it, otherwise an output port. scheme48/scsh do not have input/output ports, so it's one
or the other. You can hack simultaneous I/O on a file by opening it r/w, taking the result input
port, and duping it to an output port with @code{dup->outport}.

These are equivalent to @code{open-file}, after first including @code{read-only} or
@code{write-only} options, respectively, in the @var{options} argument. The default values for
@var{options} make the procedures backwards-compatible with their unary RnRS definitions.
}

@defproc[#:link-target? #f (pipe) (values [rport fdport?] [wport fdport?])]{
Returns two ports @var{rport} and @var{wport}, the read and write endpoints respectively of a Unix
pipe.

@subsection{Buffered I/O}

@defproc[#:link-target? #f (force-output [fd/port (or/c integer? fdport?)]) undefined]{
This procedure does nothing when applied to an integer file descriptor. It flushes buffered output
when applied to a port, and raises a write-error exception on error. Returns no value.
}

@defproc[#:link-target? #f (flush-all-ports) undefined]{
This procedure flushes all open output ports with buffered data.
}

@section{Filesystem}
Besides the procedures in this section, which allow access to the computer's file system, scsh also
provides a set of procedures which manipulate file @emph{names}. These string-processing procedures
are documented in @; TODO @secref["manipulating-filenames"]

@deftogether[(@defproc[#:link-target? #f (create-directory [fname string?] [mode file-mode? (file-mode all)] [override? (or/c #f 'query any/c) #f]) undefined]
              @defproc[#:link-target? #f (create-fifo [fname string?] [mode file-mode? (file-mode all)] [override? (or/c #f 'query any/c) #f]) undefined]

              @defproc[#:link-target? #f (create-symlink [oldname string?] [newname string?] [override? (or/c #f 'query any/c) #f]) undefined])]{
These procedures create objects of various kinds in the file system. The @var{override?} argument
controls the action if there is already an object in the file system with the new name:

@tabular[#:sep @hspace[2]
         (list (list @code{#f} @nested{signal an error (default)})
               (list @code{'query} @nested{prompt the user})

                                          @code{delete-directory} as appropriate) before creating
                                          the new object}))]

@var{mode} defaults to @code{(file-mode all)} (but is masked by the current umask).
}

@deftogether[(@defproc[#:link-target? #f (delete-directory [fname string?]) undefined]
              @defproc[#:link-target? #f (delete-file [fname string?]) undefined]
              @defproc[#:link-target? #f (delete-filesys-object [fname string?]) undefined])]{
These procedures delete objects from the filesystem. The @code{delete-filesys-object} procedure will
delete an object of any type from the file system: files, (empty) directories, symlinks, fifos, etc.

If the object being deleted doesn't exist, @code{delete-directory} and @code{delete-file} raise an
error, while delete-filesys-object simply returns.
}

@defproc[#:link-target? #f (read-symlink [fname string?]) string?]{
Return the filename referenced by the symbolic link @var{fname}.
}

@margin-note{There is an unfortunate atomicity problem with the @code{rename-file} procedure: if you
             specify no-override, but create file @var{new-fname} sometime between
             @code{rename-file}'s existence check and the actual rename operation, your file will be
             clobbered with @var{old-fname}. There is no way to fix this problem, given the
             semantics of Unix @code{rename()}; at least it is highly unlikely to occur in
             practice.}

@defproc[#:link-target? #f (rename-file [old-fname string?] [new-fname string?] [override? (or/c #f 'query any/c) #f]) undefined]{
If you override an existing object, then @var{old-fname} and @var{new-fname} must
type-match---either both directories, or both non-directories. This is required by the semantics of
Unix @code{rename()}.

These procedures set the permission bits, owner id, and group id of a file, respectively. The file
can be specified by giving the file name, or either an integer file descriptor or a port open on the
file. Setting file user ownership usually requires root privileges.

Calling @code{sync-file} causes Unix to update the disk data structures for a given file. If
