* Dependencies

This code depends on the latest revision of scheme48
<http://s48.org/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/s48>

You'll need mercurial to check out these repositories, and the forest extension
<http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ForestExtension> to manage this repo's
submodules.

* To get started

If you haven't already, clone the repository's submodules using the command:
hg fseed .fsnap

(Until this can be done automatically), set any platform specific variables at
the top of the Makefile.

Run `make` to build everything.

Run `go` to test scsh before installing

Run `make install` to install scsh (If you dare).
