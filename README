* Dependencies

This code depends on the latest revision of scheme48 here
<http://s48.org/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/s48> with the patches here
<http://ccs.neu.edu/home/roderic/arbeit/s48> applied in the order specified
by the series file. The patches can be managed easily using mercurial queues
<http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension>.

* To get started

Make a symlink named machine to the folder with you're operating system's
name (e.g. (ln -s linux machine) for linux).

Make a copy of endian.scm.in named endian.scm with instances of @ENDIAN@ replaced
with either "little" or "big", depending on your machine.

In the user package (the default for scheme48) run the command:
,exec ,load load.scm
At this point, you can try to open the scsh structure. However, doing so will
probably give errors and warnings about missing symbols and similar things for now.
