* Dependencies

This code depends on the latest revision of scheme48
<http://s48.org/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/s48> with the patches here
<http://ccs.neu.edu/home/roderic/arbeit/s48-patches>. The patches can be managed
easily using mercurial queues <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension>.

You'll need mercurial to check out these repositories, and the forest extension
<http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ForestExtension> to manage this repo's
submodules.

* To get started

If you haven't already, clone the repository's submodules using the command:
hg fseed .fsnap

Make a symlink named machine to the folder with you're operating system's
name (e.g. (ln -s linux machine) for linux).

Make a copy of endian.scm.in named endian.scm with instances of @ENDIAN@ replaced
with either "little" or "big", depending on your machine.

Build the C code. This requires an older version of scsh installed.
./build.scm

In setup.scm, change the last argument in set-global-translation! to the absolute
path of the scsh directory.

In the user package (the default for scheme48) run the command:
,exec ,load load.scm
At this point, you can try to open the scsh structure. However, doing so will
probably give errors and warnings about missing symbols and similar things for now.
