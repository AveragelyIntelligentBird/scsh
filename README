* Dependencies

This code depends on the latest revision of scheme48 here
<http://ccs.neu.edu/home/roderic/arbeit/>. It follows the scheme48 development
repository <http://www.s48.org/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/s48> as closely as possible
while adding bug fixes and additions needed for scsh to run.

* To get started

Make a symlink named machine to the folder with you're operating system's
name (e.g. (ln -s linux machine) for linux).

Make a copy of endian.scm.in named endian.scm with instances of @ENDIAN@ replaced
with either "little" or "big", depending on your machine.

In the user package (the default for scheme48) run the command:
,exec ,load load.scm
This will leave the scsh package in the environment. Opening it will probably
give errors and warnings about missing symbols and similar things for now.
